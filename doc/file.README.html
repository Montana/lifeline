<p>
Methods for creating lifeline tasks. This allows you to write cron jobs
that restart processes that die while ensuring the code is only executing
only once (avoiding the duplication that sometimes happens using the
&#8216;daemons&#8217;) gem. Both a generic lifeline method is provided as
well as methods to create 3 lifeline rake tasks for managing lifelines.
</p>
<h2>The Lifeline Approach</h2>
<p>
For all their history, daemons can be problematic. For starters, mechanisms
for restarting daemons that have failed often rely on a third-party
application like monit which is itself a daemon. In addition, PID-based
mechanisms to ensure only one daemon is running at a time fail in both
ways, sometimes preventing a daemon from starting up and other times not
preventing multiple instances from running.
</p>
<p>
The lifeline pattern (originally presented to me by Matt Todd of Highgroove
Studios) is a different approach that uses a cron job that runs every
minute as a lifeline to restart the daemon process if it has died. This
lifeline calls ps to see if another instance of the same command is already
running. If it is, the lifeline exits immediately. Otherwise, it stays
running indefinitely (Cron starts all jobs via a fork, so it can run
forever without stalling out cron). The trick is figuring out the right
invocation to ps to ensure you are only checking for apps with the same
name. But the lifeline gem handles all this to you.
</p>
<p>
Although lifelines can work well for processes that run forever, the
technique can also be used to safeguard any code you only want to run a
single instance of at a time (eg, if you have a cron job that runs every 5
minutes and you want to ensure it doesn&#8217;t run 2 processes should the
first cron job get delayed.)
</p>
<h2>How a Lifeline Works</h2>
<p>
More specifically, the lifeline method (and rake task that calls it) does
the following steps:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Get a list of all running processes

</li>
<li>Find the name of the current process by looking for the command associated
with the current process id (the $$ variable)

</li>
<li>If there is another process with the same command string, return and exit

</li>
<li>Otherwise yield to run the passed block.

</li>
</ul>
<p>
Note that you do not pass a command name to the lifeline, it uses the
command of the process invoking the Lifeline code. This means if you call
lifeline code simultaneously from a Rake task and a Rails process, it will
be executed in both cases (it&#8217;s NOT a mutex or semaphore). Also, this
mechanism uses a global namespace. means you will want to give unique names
to the processes that ultimately invoke your lifeline code. If app1 and
app2 both have a rake task named &quot;lifeline,&quot; they will interfere
with each other (&quot;app1:lifeline&quot; and &quot;app2:lifeline&quot;
are much better).
</p>

<h2>Note on Patches/Pull Requests</h2>
<ul>
<li>Fork the project.

</li>
<li>Make your feature addition or bug fix.

</li>
<li>Add tests for it. This is important so I don&#8217;t break it in a future
version unintentionally.

</li>
<li>Commit, do not mess with rakefile, version, or history. (if you want to
have your own version, that is fine but bump version in a commit by itself
I can ignore when I pull)

</li>
<li>Send me a pull request. Bonus points for topic branches.

</li>
</ul>
